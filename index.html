         	 I'm an extrovert who enjoys being the center of attention. I've been involved with the scene since I was a kid
        an eight year old piano and concerts are an integral part of me. I always knew I was going to do something related
        for the media, I volunteered at news agencies, broadcasters, building my own path. For myself
        I can say that I am an ambitious, persistent, dynamic, hardworking and dedicated person. Also, I always do
        more than one thing at a time and working under stressful situations is no problem for me. I think it is
        Multitasking in the world of journalism is crucial. I have excellent communication skills and have been successful
        establishing communication with people helped me achieve my goals. I consider myself
        a versatile person who knows many spheres in life, of course, I study every day until death.
        I think I have reached my maximum in gaining knowledge and I love to work. I can say I own it
        a competitive spirit within myself that gives me impetus to work. My experiences in schooling, working and volunteering are
        helped me find myself and formed part of my personality. I love challenges and I view every success as
        motivation to achieve the goals I set for myself. <br><br>
